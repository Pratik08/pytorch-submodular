class PriorityQueue(object):
    """A priority queue implementation.

    This is an implemented of a priority queue using a heap implemtnation. It
    has O(log n) time for adding and popping elements but constant time
    deletion. It is based off of the implementation that is provided at

    https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html

    This implementation assumes that the items with the highest priority
    are the ones with the lowest "weight" that gets passed in. If higher
    weights are supposed to correspond to higher priority, consider reversing
    the sign of the weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Attributes
    ----------
    pq : list
        A list containing the heapified priority queue.

    lookup : dict
        A dictionary containing links to each of the elements, allowing
        constant time lookups and deletions.

        This adds in an element to the priority queue. If that element is
        already there it will automatically delete the previous instance
        and replace it with the new instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : object
            The object to be encoded.

        weight : double
            The priority of the item. The lower the weight the higher the
            priority when items get dequeued. If a higher weight is supposed
            to correspond to a higher priority, consider reversing the sign of
